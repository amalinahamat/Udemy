Python is a intepreter language
- it read the program line by line
- it translates only one line of program at a time into machine code
- it produce intermediate code after translation
- it takes less amount of time to analyze the source code
- it is slower
- it requires less memory space


intepreter works
source code(basic.py) --> puthon byte codes(basic.pvc) intermediate instruction --> pvm (python virtual machine) --> output

Applications pf python
- web development (django and flask)
- data analysis and visualitzation (numpy, pandas, and matplotlib)
- machine learning and ai (TensorFlow and scikit-learn)
- scientific computing (pysics, astronomy and biology)

advantages of python
- readability
- versality
- large standard library
- cross-platform compatibility 

Python variable
- a container that stored the data value
- variable_name = variable_value
- a = 10
- name = "amal"
- can only contains letters, numbers, and underscore.
- cannot start with number
- should not conflict with keywords like print, if, for
- case sensitive, small and upper letter and differ
- dont have to specify the data types for the variables

Keywords in Python
- if, else, for, while, def, return, import, class, True, False, None, etc
- case-sensitive, cannor be used as variable names or function names
- reserved word in python

Datatypes and type casting in python
- int, float, string, list, tuple, dictionary
- typecasting is just convertion of one data type to another data type

ID IN PYTHON - Address of value
- same value will have same address memory location
