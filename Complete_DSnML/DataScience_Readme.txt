NumPy 
- powerful open source library for scientific computing in Python.
- it provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along 
with the large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
1. Arrays => data structure in NumPy
2. Universal Functions => ufuncs built in functions
3. Linear algebra => have robust linear algebra capabilities, allow users to perform matrix operation,
eigenvalue computations and more

why is NumPy faster than List?
1. NumPy uses efficient low-level languages like c and fortran under the hood, allowing fast numerical computations
2. NumPy vectors and arrays are more memory-efficient than Python's nuilt-in lists, requiring less space to store the same data
3. NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently

types of arrays in NumPy
1. 1-dimensional arrays(vectors) => these are the most basic type of NumPy arrays, representing a single dimension of data
2. 2-dimensional arrays(matrices) => these arrays have two dimensions, representing rows and columns and are useful for storing tabular data
3. N-dimensional arrays(Tensors) => These arrays can have any number of dimensions, allowing for complex, multi-dimensional data structures like images or video

NumPy data types
 - int, float, complex, bool, object

advantages of NumPy
1. high performance
2. memory efficiencies
3. vectorized operations


Pandas
- powerful open-source library fro data manipulation and analysis.
- provides efficient data structures and data analysis tools for working with structured (tabular, multidiemnsional, potentially heteregenous) and time series data
1. data frame => 2-dimensioanl labeled data structure with rows and columns similar to spreadsheet or SQL table
2. data cleaning => have robust data cleaning capabilities, allow to handle missing values, normalize data and perform advanced transformations
3. data analysys => have wide range of analytical tools, including filtering, grouping, sorting, and aggergaring data to uncover insight


Matplotlib
- comprehensive library for creating static, animated and interactive visualizations in Python.
- provides wide range of plotting functions to help us unlock insights from our data
1. line plots => visualize trends and relationship over time
2. scatter plots => between 2 variables
3. bar charts => categorical data using horizontal or vertical bar chats


Seaborn
- powerful data visualization library built on top of matplotlib
- provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics
1. scatter plot => 2 variables
2. heatmaps => display the correlation between features in a dataset
3. violin plots => visualize the distribution of data using smoothed density curves known as violin plots


Advantages of Data Science
1. enhanced decision-making
    data science provides data-driven insights to help organizations make informed, strategic decisions that drive better outcomes
2. improved efficiencies
    leveraging data science techniques can automate processes, identify optimization opportunities, and streamline operations 
    for greater productivity
3. competitive advantage
    extracting value from data allows businesses to gain a competitive edge by uncovering market trend, customer preferences 
    and new business opportunities
4. innovation and disruption
    data science fuels innovation by enabling the development of new products, services, and business models that sidrupt industries
