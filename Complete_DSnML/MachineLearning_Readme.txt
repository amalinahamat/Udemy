INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING

    - machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn from data

TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

    1. Supervised learning
    - Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset. The model learn to make predictions
    by mapping input data to the output labels

        a. regression
        - regression algorithms predict continuous values, such as predicting house prices based on input features

            i. Linear regression 
            - linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between
            the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
            when there is only one independent feature, it is known as simple linear regression and when there are more than one feature,
            it is known as multiple linear regression

                a. simple linear regression
                b. multiple linear regression

            ii. 

        b. classification algorithms are used to predict discrete categories such as classifying emails as spam or non-spam


    2. Unsupervised learning
    - Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, aiming to uncover hidden patterns or intrisic structures
    within the dataset

        a. clustering
        - clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on certain features or characteristics

        b. dimensionality reduction
        - these algorithms reduce the number of input variables while retaining important information


APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING

    1. healthcare
    - machine learning is used in disease diagnosis, personalized treatment and drug discovery

    2. e-commerce
    - it is employed for product recommendations, fraud detection and dynamic pricing

    3. finance
    - machine learning helps in risk assessment, algorithms trading and fraud prevention
